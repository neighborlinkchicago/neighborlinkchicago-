    <h2>Connecting Chicago to Resources & Housing</h2>
    <p>
      NeighborLink Chicago was founded on the belief that every neighbor matters. Inspired by our faith, we work to connect Chicago’s underserved communities to life-giving resources — from food and housing, to nonprofit support and spiritual care.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe love looks like action. That’s why we’re building more than a website — we’re building a network of help, a bridge of hope, and a foundation for affordable housing that lifts families out of crisis and into stability.
    </p>

      Whether you're in need or want to serve, you're welcome here.
